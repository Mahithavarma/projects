# Ecomm_Funnel_Efficiency

I use this project to find and fix conversion leaks across the e-commerce funnel—fast. It standardizes clickstream + orders + marketing spend, publishes trustworthy funnel KPIs, ranks bottlenecks by impact, and validates fixes with experiments.

## Technologies Used
- **Languages**: Python (3.10+), SQL  
- **Data/Modeling**: dbt Core (1.6+), SQL models  
- **Warehouses**: Snowflake / BigQuery / Redshift (pick one)  
- **ETL/Orchestration (optional)**: Airflow, Dagster, or GitHub Actions  
- **Viz/Apps (optional)**: Streamlit / Dash  
- **Testing/Quality**: pytest, dbt tests, pre-commit  
- **DevX**: Makefile, Docker (optional)

---

## Requirements
- Python **3.10+**  
- dbt Core **1.6+** and access to a supported warehouse  
- Warehouse credentials with permission to create/read schemas  
- (Optional) Node 18+ if you’re using any JS build steps; Docker if you want containerized runs

---

## Installation
```bash
# 1) Clone
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_ORG/Ecomm_Funnel_Efficiency.git
cd Ecomm_Funnel_Efficiency

# 2) Python env
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt  # or: pipx/poetry

# 3) Environment config
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your warehouse + source creds
# e.g. SNOWFLAKE_ACCOUNT, DB_NAME, SCHEMA, USER, PASSWORD, GA4_KEY, SHOPIFY_TOKEN

# 4) dbt profile
# Create/merge into ~/.dbt/profiles.yml (example below)E-comm Funnel & Efficiency — SQL funnel and BI views.

Typical workflow
	1.	Ingest sources (clickstream, orders, marketing spend).
	2.	Run dbt build to materialize: stg_* → int_* → fct_funnel_*.
	3.	Check KPIs: stage conversion rates, AOV, CAC, LTV.
	4.	Inspect bottleneck ranking and anomaly flags (views in /dashboards or Streamlit).
	5.	Ship a change → log an experiment → run the experiment readout notebook to measure lift.
---
Contribution Guidelines
	•	Issues: Use templates for bug reports/feature requests. Add repro steps + expected vs actual.
	•	Branches: feature/<slug> or fix/<slug>. Use small, focused PRs.
	•	Commits: Conventional commits (feat:, fix:, docs:, refactor:).
	•	Tests: Add/extend unit tests (pytest) and dbt tests for new models.
	•	Style: Run pre-commit hooks locally (ruff, black, sqlfluff) before pushing.
	•	CI: All checks must pass (lint, unit, dbt compile/build dry-run).
