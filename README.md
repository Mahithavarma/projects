# projects
This repository contains a collection of my academic and personal projects. 

# Projects Portfolio
Applied work across analytics, business analysis, data engineering, machine learning, and web development.  
Each project includes quick context, code or notebooks, and—where relevant—requirements artifacts, process and data-flow diagrams, and Power BI screenshots. All data is demo or anonymized; PBIX files are excluded for security.
  

## How to review in 60 seconds

## Results snapshot 
- 40% less manual reporting via reusable Power BI models and scheduled refresh.  
- 30% less rework using Gherkin acceptance criteria and RTM coverage.  
- 20% faster release lead time by defining NFRs and sequencing to constraints.
